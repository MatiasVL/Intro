    <h1>ETF's</h1>
    <p>Exchange Traded Funds, or ETF's, are also called 'trackers'. This is because they track the value of the underlying assets. These assets can be different things,
      such as a stock market index (such as the BEL20) or a specific material (such as oil).</p>
    <p>An ETF which tracks a specific market index is also called an index tracker. These index trackers are similar to the investment funds offered by banks.
     The big difference however is that actively managed funds are, well, actively managed. This means they are accompanied by high fees, in order to compensate the fund managers and
   pay for the frequent purchasing and selling costs.
    </p>
    <p>However, it's actually quite difficult for active fund managers to consistently achieve higher-than-average trading results. When you then add the
      frequent transaction costs and high management fees, most actively managed funds will underperform the market </p>
    <p>Some other important options to consider investing in are bonds and specific stocks. Bonds offer on average less risk and less return than stocks, and are therefore more recommended for shorter investment horizons (or if you're expecting a downturn).
    Specific stocks are very high-risk: a lot can happen with one specific company. Its stock value may double in a year, or the company can go bankrupt. Furthermore, deciding on which stock to invest in requires quite some
  analysis and understanding of the company's financial figures, which is not really feasible for most people. </p>
    <p>Index trackers on the other hand simply track their underlying index. As such, their results will be quite average. However, considering that the S&P500 (an index representing the 500 biggest US companies) grew by +-10% per year the last 100 years, those average market returns may be quite nice.
      What's more, ETF's they offer very low costs (being 'passive'), often as low as 0.20% per year.</p>
    <p>Now, what is a good index to track? The BEL20 consists of only the 20 biggest Belgian companies. Being all Belgian, any event which would negatively impact the Belgian economy would hit your investments hard.</p>
    <p>Luckily, you can go bigger than that. How about an ETF which tracks the 438 biggest European companies (MSCI Europe index)? Or if you want to really spread your risk, you can track something like the MSCI World, an index consisting of over 1600 of the biggest companies in developed countries. </p>
    <p>With index tracker ETF's, you don't have to worry about analysing specific stocks, or with helping your bank get richer. These days, there are plenty of online brokers where you can trade on the markets yourself, and get yourself some decent returns.</p>
