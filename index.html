    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Matias. I've studied sociology and business economics, worked for a short while in a bank and for a longer while in the car leasing sector.
    I find the digitisation process very interesting. Regular people like you and me can trade stocks from their computer at home, apps can be developed to connect people with similar interests,
  cars can be programmed to drive automatically, supermarkets can predict what you would like to eat and get your shopping ready for you,... The possibilities within IT are so vast and fascinating,
   I would love to build my career on it. You can imagine how happy I was when I found the opportunity to become a software developer.

      <h1>Index Investing</h1>
    <p>Interests on savings accounts are at historical lows, so what does an <em>average</em> person do in order to make their money work for them? Renting out real estate requires a decent amount of capital,
     the investment funds your bank offers you come with high costs, and you have no idea how to pick the right stocks to invest in. </p>
  <p>A great alternative are Exchange Traded Funds, or ETF's. Low-cost and highly diversified. Click here if you want to read more about <a href="ETF.html">ETF's</a>.</p>
